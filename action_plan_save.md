# Update new languages action plan:

Action Plan for Updating Additional Programming Languages in template.j2
Based on my analysis of the codebase, here's a comprehensive action plan to update additional programming languages in the AI Code Converter application:

Current State
The application supports 6 languages: Python, Julia, JavaScript, Go, Java, and C++
The template.j2 file already contains instructions for 11 additional languages that aren't currently enabled
For each new language, we need to update multiple components
Action Plan (to be implemented one at a time)
Phase 1: Prepare Core Components for Each Language
For each new language to be added (Ruby, Swift, Rust, C#, TypeScript, R, Perl, Lua, PHP, Kotlin, SQL):

Update language_detection.py:
Add a new static detection method for the language (e.g., detect_ruby)
Create regex patterns specific to the language's syntax
Add the new detector to the detectors dictionary in the init method
Update config.py:
Add the language to the SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES list
Add a language mapping entry in LANGUAGE_MAPPING for syntax highlighting
Test language detection:
Create test cases for the new language detector
Ensure the detector correctly identifies code in that language

###### DONE
Phase 2: Enhance Gradio UI for New Languages
For each language:

Update app.py:
Modify the button texts and labels to include the new language
Add the appropriate language syntax highlighting support
Update the UI language selection dropdowns
Update run functionality:
If the language requires special execution capabilities, update the CodeExecutor class

###### DONE -----
Phase 3: Update Template Enhancement and Testing
For each language:

Review and enhance template.j2 instructions:
The template already has sections for additional languages
Review and update the language-specific instructions for each new language
Add any missing best practices or language-specific details
Update docstring style options as needed
End-to-end Testing:
Test the conversion from/to the new language
Verify that the generated code follows the language's best practices
Test edge cases and complex code samples
Implementation Order
I recommend implementing the languages in this order, based on complexity and similarity to existing supported languages:

TypeScript (similar to JavaScript, easier to validate)
Ruby (popular, well-defined syntax)
Rust (modern language with strong typing)
C# (similar to Java, well-structured)
Swift (mobile development language)
Kotlin (similar to Java)
PHP (widely used web language)
R (statistical language)
Lua (embedded scripting language)
Perl (text processing language)
SQL (database language, very different paradigm)
For Each Language Implementation
When implementing each language, I'll follow this process:

Start with language detection implementation
Update configuration files
Review and enhance the template instructions if needed
Update UI components
Test the language conversion in both directions
Document any language-specific considerations
Would you like me to start by implementing the first language on this list (TypeScript)?

<!-- UI Update Action Plan
Step 1: Add Dark/Light Mode Toggle Button
Modify the CSS in config.py to include styles for both light and dark modes
Update the header section in app.py to include a toggle button next to the title
Add JavaScript code to handle the theme switching functionality
Create CSS variable-based theme settings (colors, backgrounds, etc.)
Store theme preference in browser localStorage for persistence -->

# DONE 
Step 2: Add Document Checkbox Row 
please not not break, the code. be careful not to break the dynamic dropdown.
Create a new row above the Upload accordion in app.py
Add a checkbox component labeled "Document" with a default checked state
Add state handling to track the checkbox status
Connect the checkbox state to control the visibility of the document type dropdown
Style the new row to match the existing UI design

# DONE
Step 3: Improve Document Type Dropdown
please not not break, the code. be careful not to break the dynamic dropdown.
Extract document style options from the template.j2 file for each language
Create a function to parse the template.j2 file and extract document types per language
Implement dynamic population of the document type dropdown based on the selected target language
Update the prompt template to include conditionals for the documentation settings
Pass the document parameters to the template.render() call
Update any model-specific prompt handling to respect these settings

Add visibility control based on the document checkbox state
Connect the dropdown selection to the code conversion process
# DONE  
Step 4: Update Application Logic
Modify the code conversion function to incorporate the selected document type
Update the template rendering to include the selected document style
Ensure proper state management between components
Add event listeners to update document types when language selection changes
Handle default values for document types when switching languages


# ONGOIONG ----
Step 5: Testing & Final Adjustments
Test all combinations of languages and document types
Verify the dark/light mode toggle works correctly
Test the document checkbox functionality
Ensure responsive design works on different screen sizes
Implement any final UI adjustments for consistency
